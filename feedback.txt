I have approved it but my comment is about the formatting, which is not part of the acceptance criteria.  Arguably the technical skills should be visible on the first page of the CV because it may be something that the recruiter is looking for.  Recruiters spend maybe 15 to 30 seconds on each CV so having to look on page 2 might lead to important information being missed.  You might think that every recruiter reads everything on every CV but if you have 100 or even 1000 CVs to look through for a particular vacancy, one of the rejection criteria is likely to be "have they formatted it so I can see all the relevant information immediately on page 1?"
